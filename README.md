## Overview
The Social Media Post Caption Generator allows users to input specific content topics (e.g., food, travel, fitness), choose a tone (e.g., motivational, funny), specify a platform (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn), and set the desired caption length. The app then uses Google Cloud's Gemini AI model to generate a catchy, context-aware social media caption.

## Features
‚Ä¢	Generate captions based on content type, tone, platform, and length.
‚Ä¢	Easy-to-use interface for submitting data.
‚Ä¢	Firebase handles backend logic, including querying the Gemini API for caption generation.
‚Ä¢	Store and manage user data securely with Firestore.

## Technologies Used
‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
‚Ä¢	Backend: Firebase Functions (with Node.js)
‚Ä¢	AI: Google Cloud's Gemini 
‚Ä¢	Database: Firestore for storing user data
‚Ä¢	Hosting: Firebase Hosting

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Services
‚Ä¢	Create a Google Cloud Project: Start by creating a new project on Google Cloud. Enable Vertex AI and Firebase services.
‚Ä¢	Enable Gemini API: Access Google Cloud's Gemini API via Vertex AI and generate an API key.
‚Ä¢	Install Firebase SDK: Run the following command to set up Firebase in your project:
                           npm install -g firebase-tools
                           firebase init
## Step 2: Frontend Development
‚Ä¢	Form Inputs: The user can select content type (e.g., ‚Äúfood‚Äù, ‚Äútravel‚Äù), tone (e.g., ‚Äúfunny‚Äù, ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù), platform (e.g., ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù, ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù), and caption length.
‚Ä¢	Submit Button: When the user clicks the ‚ÄúGenerate Captions‚Äù button, the frontend sends the data to the Firebase function via a POST request.
‚Ä¢	Results Display: After receiving the generated caption from the backend, the frontend displays it to the user in a clean and user-friendly format.

## Step 3: Backend Logic with Firebase Functions
‚Ä¢	User Input: The frontend sends the user‚Äôs choices to Firebase (content, tone, platform, length).
‚Ä¢	Generate Caption: The Firebase function forms a prompt like:
           ‚ÄúGenerate a funny caption for Instagram about food. Keep it under 150 characters.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Call Gemini AI: This prompt is sent to Gemini, which uses advanced natural language processing to craft the perfect caption.
‚Ä¢	Return Response: The generated caption is sent back to the frontend for display.

## Step 4: Deploy the application
‚Ä¢	Once everything is in place, it‚Äôs time to deploy the app. With Firebase Hosting, it‚Äôs easy to go live in just a few commands.
        Deploy Firebase Functions: firebase deploy --only functions
        Deploy Firebase Hosting: firebase deploy --only hosting
